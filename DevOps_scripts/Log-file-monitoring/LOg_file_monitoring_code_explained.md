INFO: Starting application
ERROR: An error occurred in module X
INFO: Application running smoothly
Here's what will happen step-by-step with the updated code:

Opening the File: The tail_log function is called with the path to your log file.
python
Copy code
log_file_path = "/path/to/your/logfile.log"
tail_log(log_file_path)
Reading from the Beginning: The open function opens the file in read mode, and the file object points to the beginning of the file.
python
Copy code
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
First Iteration of the Loop:
python
Copy code
while True:
Reading the First Line:
python
Copy code
line = file.readline()
The first line ("INFO: Starting application") is read and stored in the variable line.

Checking for EOF:
python
Copy code
if not line:
    time.sleep(0.1)
    continue
Since line is not empty, this block is skipped.

Checking for "ERROR":
python
Copy code
if "ERROR" in line:
    print(f"Error detected: {line.strip()}")
The line does not contain "ERROR", so this block is skipped.

Second Iteration of the Loop:
Reading the Second Line:
python
Copy code
line = file.readline()
The second line ("ERROR: An error occurred in module X") is read and stored in the variable line.

Checking for EOF:

Since line is not empty, this block is skipped.

Checking for "ERROR":

python
Copy code
if "ERROR" in line:
    print(f"Error detected: {line.strip()}")
The line contains "ERROR", so the script prints:

vbnet
Copy code
Error detected: ERROR: An error occurred in module X
Third Iteration of the Loop:
Reading the Third Line:
python
Copy code
line = file.readline()
The third line ("INFO: Application running smoothly") is read and stored in the variable line.

Checking for EOF:

Since line is not empty, this block is skipped.

Checking for "ERROR":

The line does not contain "ERROR", so this block is skipped.

Fourth Iteration of the Loop:
Reading the Next Line:
python
Copy code
line = file.readline()
The end of the file is reached, so line is set to an empty string ("").

Checking for EOF:
python
Copy code
if not line:
    time.sleep(0.1)
    continue
Since line is empty, the script sleeps for 0.1 seconds and then continues to the next iteration of the loop.

The loop will continue to read new lines if they are appended to the log file. If a new line containing "ERROR" is added, it will be detected and printed as described above.

Example with Log File Growing
Suppose, after some time, a new error is logged:

vbnet
Copy code
INFO: Starting application
ERROR: An error occurred in module X
INFO: Application running smoothly
ERROR: Another error occurred
The script, in its continuous loop, will read this new line on its next iteration after it has been written to the file.
It will detect the new "ERROR" line and print:
vbnet
Copy code
Error detected: ERROR: Another error occurred
Summary
The script starts reading from the beginning of the log file.
It prints any line containing "ERROR" as it reads through the file.
After reaching the end of the file, it waits for new lines to be added and processes them as they appear.
This ensures that any existing errors in the log file are detected and printed when the script first runs, and any new errors are caught in real-time as they are logged.
